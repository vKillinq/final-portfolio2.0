<h1 class="project23">Projects i have done over the years of being in Information technology high school</h1>
<div class="projects">
  <p class="des-2">1. This is one of my projects that i have done. It was school project On what to watch. The purpose on this project was to make a website that would recommend what to watch based on the genre you picked. Making these project was a great experience because it was a demo to what i would make later on in the year still was fun a big problem i had with this was making sure you get the right genre and the movie you got suggested was right. </p>
